My goal is to grow professionally in IT. I am interested in working in an international company, constantly learning and developing, as well as improving my English. Thanks to my experience in tourism, I have gained skills in communication, solving complex problems, attention to details, discipline in work. I started to study JS independently in summer 2023, many topics seemed absolutely incomprehensible. A year later I already know why typeof null = object, I'm solving problems on Codewars and studying promises and event loop. Nothing is impossible, you just need to clearly define the goal and the steps to achieve it, and constantly act. I plan to find my first commercial project in a year and start my career as a front-end developer.
